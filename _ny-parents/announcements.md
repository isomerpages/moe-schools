### Materials & Information Sheets for JC1 Parents
Dear JC1 Parents, The Principalâ€™s sharing session was held on 9 February. The Powerpoint slides handout is attached for your reference. Both General Paper and Project Work are new and compulsory subjects for JC students. To help you gain a better understanding of these subjects, we have prepared information sheets for these two subjects for you. Thank you.
