**2021 GCE A-Level Oral Examinations**

Dear Parents/Guardians,

To safeguard the safety and well-being of students and school staff, MOE and the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB) will be putting in place enhanced Safe Management Measures (SMMs) for the 2021 Singapore Cambridge GCE N(A)/N(T)/O/A-level oral examinations.

All candidates and oral examiners will be required to wear surgical masks during the examination. While processes will be in place to ensure that examiners and candidates can hear each other clearly, the wearing of masks will be taken into consideration when assessing the candidates. SMMs such as temperature screening for entry into schools, frequent cleaning of high touch surfaces and using well ventilated venues will continue to be in place.

As the oral examinations are conducted over several days, candidates who miss the oral examinations with valid reasons can take the examinations on another date or sit for the make-up oral examination.

Please see the attached press release for more information on the enhanced SMMs for oral examinations. MOE and SEAB will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation and provide updates if there are further changes to the arrangements for this yearâ€™s national examinations.
