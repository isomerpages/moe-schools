Dear Parents/Guardians,

Following the announcement last evening regarding the vaccination for students, we have prepared a document outlining the common test and exam schedule, dates of important college events and activities to help you in choosing the most suitable dates for your child's vaccination. In the document, we have also included additional information for parents/guardians who would not be getting the SMS invites, the Parent Kit and Info Sheet prepared by MOE.
