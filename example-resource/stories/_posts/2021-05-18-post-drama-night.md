The English Drama Club held its annual Drama Night in LT4 on 7 May 2021. Due to the SMM in place at the time, we played to a very limited, socially-distanced audience, and had to cancel our performance on 8 May due to the new SMM restrictions that kicked in. The play we staged was “Good People”, written by a renowned Singaporean playwright, Haresh Sharma, and originally created by The Necessary Stage. “Good People” is set in a hospice and showcases the ups and downs of the relationships among three people: Regina, the new and ambitious Medical Director trying to run a tight ship. Yati, a jaded nurse making the best of a ‘dead-end’ job and Krishnan, a terminally-ill patient with a marijuana addiction to relieve his pain.
